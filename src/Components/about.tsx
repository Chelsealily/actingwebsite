        Chelsea Li is a British East Asian actor based in London with a background in screen acting and commercial modelling. Often cast in roles that lean mysterious, glamorous, or emotionally layered. Her recent work includes a featured role in a major studio film (handpicked by Oscar-winning director Bong Joon-ho), alongside a mix of indie thrillers and fashion-led short films.
        Though her native accent is British/Kent, she is also successful in booking work in a US/Cali accent. She trained at The Actors' Temple and London School of Screen Acting and has also undertaken various acting workshops and 1-2-1's with working actors, directors and casting agents.
        When she's not on set, youâ€™ll find her building her own creative projects as an Actress, Model and a Software Engineer, all whilst quietly plotting world domination over a matcha latte with her little chihuahua.
